Numcrypt Encryption Language User Guide

1. Introduction

Numcrypt is a simple encryption language that converts letters into numbers based on their position in the English alphabet. This system uses specific symbols to separate letters, sentences, and lines to maintain clarity in the encrypted text.

2. Encryption Rules

Each letter is converted into its corresponding alphabetical number:

A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26

Symbols and punctuation marks remain unchanged.

Use "-" to separate letters within a word.

Use "/" to separate sentences within the same line.

Use "//" to indicate a new line or a new paragraph.

Use "." at the end of the encrypted text.

When decrypting, all letters are converted into uppercase (CAPITAL LETTERS).

3. Encryption Examples

Example 1: A Single Word

HELLO → 8-5-12-12-15.

Example 2: A Sentence with Multiple Words

HELLO WORLD → 8-5-12-12-15 / 23-15-18-12-4.

Example 3: Multiple Sentences in the Same Line

HELLO, HOW ARE YOU? → 8-5-12-12-15, / 8-15-23 / 1-18-5 / 25-15-21.

Example 4: Two Paragraphs (New Line Between Them)

GOOD MORNING  
HAVE A NICE DAY  

7-15-15-4 / 13-15-18-14-9-14-7 // 8-1-22-5 / 1 / 14-9-3-5 / 4-1-25.

4. Decryption

Replace the numbers with their corresponding letters based on the alphabetical chart.

Convert all letters to uppercase (CAPITAL LETTERS).

Keep symbols and punctuation marks unchanged.

5. Additional Notes

If there are multiple spaces between sentences, // can be used instead of / for clearer separation.

Future improvements may include more advanced encryption techniques like substitution or shifting.
